## My process
I went with using SCSS instead to start practicing more modern CSS methods, and it was great. I loved being able to think about my CSS in a more hierarchical like HTML. Why didn't they have this initially? Better late than never I suppose. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS/SASS

### What I learned

I learned about SCSS/SASS and some of its syntax! It was a great learning experience for me to learn the more modern way of setting CSS properties. I also learned about absolute positioning for child elements onto parent elements; that's actually what I had trouble for the longest time since I couldn't get the hover to work for only the image. 

### Continued development

I couldn't get the eye view image to keep it's 100% opacity when the hover action is initiated. That's what I'll be keeping an eye out for. 

### Useful resources

- [https://css-tricks.com/how-to-stack-elements-in-css/](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-stack-elements-in-css/) - This article was great in giving me a step-by-step visual on super-posing a child element on top of a parent element which ultimately helped me finish this design!
